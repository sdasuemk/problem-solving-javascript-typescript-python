Given an array arr[] of size n containing 0 and 1 only.
 The problem is to count the subarrays having an equal number of 0’s and 1’s.

Examples:  

Input: arr[] = {1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1}
Output: 8
Explanation: The index range for the 8 sub-arrays are:
 (0, 1), (2, 3), (0, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)(2, 5), (0, 5), (1, 6)

Input: arr = { 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1}

Find a peak element which is not smaller than its neighbours

Given an array arr of n elements that is first strictly increasing and then maybe strictly
 decreasing, find the maximum element in the array.

Note: If the array is increasing then just print the last element will be the maximum value.

Example:

Input: array[]= {5, 10, 20, 15}
Output: 20
Explanation: The element 20 has neighbors 10 and 15, both of them are less than 20.
